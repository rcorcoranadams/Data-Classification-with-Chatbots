# Lab 2 - Data Classification & Chatbots
Name: Rachel Corcoran-Adams
Date created: September 11, 2020
Python Version: 2.7.5

Script 1 introduces classifying data using the function called "FeelTemp". This function converts a given temperature in Fahrenheit and classifies it based on four different categorical temperature feelings: hot, warm, cool, and cold. Using a decision tree, I created conditional statements involving values to separate each temperature block into the four categories. 
Script 2 introduces the concept of chatbots using the function "Preference'. This function follows a decision tree and uses if, elif, and else statements to to capture an input from a user and return a string. This particular code follows the idea of "Taste" where the program will decide whether or not it prefers a specifc taste, sweet or salty. All other tastes inputted by the user it is "indifferent". 

An issue I encouuntered was it ws originally just returning my original string. In order to fix this, I reassigned the function "Preference" using input "reply". The "Using nested decisions tatements in python for dummies" article helped me a lot.
